Ask me about workouts, nutrition, recovery, or motivation. What's on your mind?"},{keywords:["motivation","motivated","lazy","don't want to"],response:"Remember: you don't have to be motivated to show up. Discipline beats motivation every time. The best workout is the one you almost skipped. What's holding you back today?"},{keywords:["sore","soreness","doms","recovery"],response:"Soreness means your muscles are adapting. Make sure you're sleeping 7-9 hours, eating enough protein (1.6-2.2g per kg bodyweight), and staying hydrated. Light movement and stretching can help. If pain is sharp or in joints, take a rest day."},{keywords:["protein","nutrition","eat","diet","food","meal"],response:"For muscle growth, aim for 1.6-2.2g protein per kg bodyweight daily. Spread it across 3-5 meals. Good sources: chicken, eggs, Greek yogurt, lentils, fish, whey protein. Don't neglect carbs — they fuel your workouts."},{keywords:["plateau","stuck","not progressing","stalled"],response:"Plateaus are normal. Try these: (1) Increase volume — add 1 set per exercise. (2) Change rep ranges — if doing 8-12, try 5-8 heavier. (3) Improve sleep and nutrition. (4) Deload for a week at 50-60% intensity, then come back."},{keywords:["beginner","new","starting","first time"],response:"Welcome! Start with compound movements: squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press, rows. 3x per week, 3 sets of 8-12 reps. Focus on form over weight. Increase weight by the smallest increment when you hit the top of your rep range for all sets."},{keywords:["progressive overload","overload","progress"],response:"Progressive overload is THE key to growth. Each session, try to beat your last performance: more weight, more reps, or more sets. Even 1 extra rep counts. Track everything — that's what this app is for."},{keywords:["rest","rest day","off day"],response:"Rest days are when you grow. Your muscles repair and get stronger during rest, not during the workout. Take at least 1-2 full rest days per week. Active recovery (walking, light stretching) is great on off days."},{keywords:["warm up","warmup","stretch"],response:"Always warm up: 5 min light cardio, then 2-3 warm-up sets with lighter weight for your first exercise. Dynamic stretches before training, static stretches after. Never skip the warm-up — injury prevention is progress protection."},{keywords:["sleep","tired","fatigue","exhausted"],response:"Sleep is the most underrated performance enhancer. Aim for 7-9 hours. Tips: consistent bed time, no screens 30 min before bed, cool dark room, limit caffeine after 2 PM. Poor sleep = poor recovery = poor gains."},{keywords:["form","technique","how to"],response:"Good form is non-negotiable. Check the Exercise Catalog in this app for video demonstrations. Key rules: control the weight, full range of motion, don't ego lift. When in doubt, lower the weight and nail the movement pattern."},{keywords:["weight loss","lose weight","cut","fat loss"],response:"Fat loss = caloric deficit. Track your calories and aim for 300-500 cal below maintenance. Keep protein high to preserve muscle. Lift heavy — don't switch to 'light weight high reps' for fat loss. Cardio helps but diet is king."},{keywords:["bulk","gain weight","mass","muscle gain"],response:"For a lean bulk, eat 200-400 cal above maintenance. Prioritize protein (1.6-2.2g/kg). Train hard with progressive overload, focus on compound lifts. Expect to gain 0.5-1kg per month. More than that is likely excess fat."}],E="I'm not sure I understand that fully.
